PROJECT SUMMARY (LOCKED)
Title: “Deceiving Footprints — Penguin in the Fog”

Core camera + movement model:
- Camera is TILE-ANCHORED (not player-anchored).
- Camera centers on the CURRENT TILE.
- Penguin may move freely INSIDE the current tile following mouse position (cosmetic only).
- When player commits to a neighbor tile:
  - Penguin animates movement to that tile (exactly cyclesPerMovement walk cycles)
  - If destination is a trap, penguin plays ouch animation and BOUNCES BACK to previous tile
  - After movement completes (including bounce resolution), camera lerps to the resulting tile center
  - Then movement unlocks again

Game:
- Unity 2D, camera zoomed in on current tile
- Single-player, point & click
- Flat-top hexagonal grid
- Grid layout is HEX-RADIUS (a big hex made of smaller hexes)
- Movement only to 6 neighbors
- Player follows trails left by previous players (stored locally)
- Fog is NOT a visibility system: it is a fully opaque overlay sprite attached to the penguin (snowstorm/swim-ring style) that covers most of the screen. The world still renders underneath.
- Therefore: tiles and footprints are always rendered; “visibility” is purely what is covered by the fog overlay graphic.

Tiles:
- Safe tile: snow hex
- Danger tile: snow hex with HOLE
- Special tiles: Start and Finish

Trails:
- Real trails: automatically left when moving tile-to-tile (attempted move counts; actual tile-to-tile moves should be recorded; trap bounce should record the attempted move + bounce event clearly in data)
- Fake trails: placed with RMB toward selected neighbor tile
- Fake trails are LIMITED PER GAME SESSION (RUN), not per turn.
  - Add public int maxFakeTrailsPerRun
  - Track remainingFakeTrails
  - Each RMB placement consumes 1
  - When remainingFakeTrails == 0, RMB does nothing (optionally play a “deny” SFX hook)

Controls:
- Mouse hover = select neighbor tile
- LMB = confirm move
- RMB = place fake trail toward selected neighbor (consumes from remainingFakeTrails)
- Penguin drifts locally inside current tile toward mouse (purely cosmetic)

Player:
- Penguin (not ghost)
- 3 sprite variations + mirrored
- Walk animation (2-frame loop)
- Trap animation (“ouch”)

Resolution:
- 16:9 Full HD (1920x1080)

Scoring (LOCKED):
- STEP COUNT only
- Traps currently do NOT affect score (may change later)

Start screen:
- Click anywhere to start (no button)
- Minimal leaderboard top 3 (best = lowest steps):
  penguin <random short id>, steps
  penguin <random short id>, steps
  penguin <random short id>, steps

Gameplay UI (main scene):
- Step counter display
- Remaining fake trails display
- “Give Up” button:
  - Ends the run immediately
  - Saves the run to local storage (same as any run)
  - Returns to start screen (or restarts; choose one and be consistent)

Movement timing (LOCKED):
- Movement duration = animationCycleDuration * cyclesPerMovement
- Default cyclesPerMovement = 2
- Must expose public variables:
  - animationCycleDuration (float)
  - cyclesPerMovement (int)
  - cameraMoveDuration (float)
  - cameraZoom (float)

Camera:
- Centers on tile AFTER penguin finishes movement (and any bounce)
- Zoom configurable via public variable

Audio hooks (placeholders only):
BG ambience; start; win; give up; step; fake trail; mouse click; trap hit; deny fake trail (optional)

Local persistence:
- JSON in Application.persistentDataPath
- Save:
  - run traces (real steps + fake markers + timestamps + end state: finished/gave up)
  - leaderboard (top 3 by steps, random short penguin ids)
- Render trails from ALL prior runs (finished or gave up)
- Render up to N previous runs (default 5), exposed as public variable
